# poggio 

A puzzle game for exploring functional programming in a 3d environment.

## Usage

The actual game can be played by running:

lein run -m poggio.core

You can access the level-editor by running:

lein run -m tools.level-editor.core

The documentation is light for the level-editor (and will hopefully be improved), but it's a pretty straightforward interface.
